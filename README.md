# Ghana Crop Production Analysis (2000-2012)

I created this Python project to showcase my data analysis skills using real agricultural data from Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Through pandas and matplotlib, I transformed raw data into compelling insights about crop production trends.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled inconsistencies and missing values
- **Data Transformation**: Reshaped data for analysis
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Identified key trends and patterns
- **Data Visualization**: Created informative charts
- **Storytelling**: Developed narrative from data insights
- **Python Proficiency**: Used pandas, matplotlib, and numpy

## Key Insights
- Cassava dominates production, growing 79% since 2000
- Yam production surged 97% over 12 years
- Cocoyam declined 22% despite overall agricultural growth
- 2007 was a crisis year for northern crops like sorghum
- Cassava shows accelerating growth patterns
